# Autoplaylist
 This is an AutoHotkey script that automatically plays a playlist named "Autoplaylist" in your spotify library when you press win+alt+p
 
Setup:

put the compiled .exe in your startup folder, make a playlist in spotify called "Autoplaylist", press win+alt+p to play it from anywhere. 

 or

install Autokey from https://www.autohotkey.com/ and then run the attached script with it.  the .exe is just this script compiled.  If you have issues, it's likely the millisecond wait timers in the script. The timings are all based on how fast my machine launches and connects to spotify so your mileage may vary.   edit it as fits. 

no warranty or support suggested or implied. I have no idea what AutoHotkey is running.  I made this for myself and sharing.   no I will not help you setup your machine.
